## Usage

To use this visualization with your own data, simply modify the per state counts in `state_counts.json` to match your data.

### Normalization
Note: If your data is affected by population, for example you're visualizing the number of houses per state, you should normalize your data. Otherwise, you're just going to highlight states with high population and distort your visualization.
